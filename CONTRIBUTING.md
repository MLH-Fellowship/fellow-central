# Contributing to Fellow Central

Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions. Please read through these guidelines carefully before submitting a PR or issue and let us know if it's not up-to-date (or even better, submit a PR with your proposed corrections ðŸ˜‰).

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

Pull requests are welcome!

You should open an issue to discuss your pull request, unless it's a trivial change. It's best to ensure that your proposed change would be accepted so that you don't waste your own time. If you would like to implement support for a significant feature that is not yet available, please talk to us beforehand to avoid any duplication of effort.

Pull requests should generally be opened against `main`.

## Commits

Enter a properly formatted simple commit message when committing, such as:
